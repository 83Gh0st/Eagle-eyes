# Eagle-eyes
Eagle Eyes project implements real-time object detection using YOLO (You Only Look Once) with an ONNX, TFLite, TF.js model and OpenCVâ€™s Deep Neural Network (DNN) module. It enables efficient detection of multiple objects in images, videos, and webcam streams, making it ideal for applications like surveillance, construction site monitoring.
